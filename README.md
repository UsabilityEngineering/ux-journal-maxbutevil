I'm a 4th-year undergraduate computer science student with a passion for programming. I'm taking Usability Engineering to gain experience that I can apply to my future career and to my own personal projects. I've made a few UI-based games (for example, a card game and a party game) and I'd like to have a better understanding of how I can improve the UI/UX for them.
